                <h4>The context of shopping with visual impairment</h4>
                <p>Shopping for groceries and other daily supplies is self-evident to everyone and simultaneously embodies an act of independence and autonomy. Still, some people have a very different experience than others. Visual impairment, comprising in the spectrum from minor eye weakness to full blindness, is a common influential factor here. This project investigates the experience of half- and full-blind shoppers and aims to propose concepts of how to reduce hurdles and improve the shopper's experience.</p>

                <h4>Research setup</h4>
                <p>Research was conducted to understand the act of shopping and respective influence by a visual impairment. Seven participants with either half or full visual impairment as well as two caregivers were interviewed in a remote setup. While the cooperation with people of different eyesight involved some challenges interesting insights were drawn from this study.</p>
